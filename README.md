# IP-Adresses-of-a-network
 This is a small project which is assigning IP addresses for the hosts on different LANs that are connected together through three WANs. This network is in the slides of the CISCO company. I used the CISCO packet tracer software to simulate the network. Every router is connected to two switches which are then connected to the hosts.
